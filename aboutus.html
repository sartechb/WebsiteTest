            <h1 style="color:#0488C3">A Brief History of Wobetto</h1>
            <p style="font-size:26px">One very, very, late night, Sarthak and Apoorva were working on a project for a databases class they were in. Luckily, they had each other in the class because otherwise both would likely be lost in a mountain of work.</p>
            <p style="font-size:26px">They often spent long periods of time searching internet forums and scarce lecture slides, but understood little about the subject. It may have been that the material was hard, but they knew this was the case for most classes they’d taken, and for most students they’d talked with.</p>
            <p style="font-size:26px">After one too many frustrating hours, Apoorva declared, “I’m taking a break! We’re not getting anywhere on this problem.” They leaned back and started chatting for a while.</p>
            <p style="font-size:26px">“So I’ve been having this idea…” said Apoorva. “I know that there are people out there who know how to do this stuff! If we could just figure out a way to meet with them - I’m thinking we create a way to help people in the same class study together.”</p>
            <p style="font-size:26px">Sarthak stared at him blankly. “Is this a joke?” he asked.</p>
            <p style="font-size:26px">Apoorva was slightly confused. “No? I’m actually serious.”</p>
            <p style="font-size:26px">“I’m working on an app that does exactly that. I mean I don’t have anything built yet, but I have a idea for it and I’ve been gathering people to start making it. It’s called StudyBuddy”, he explained. “You should join our team”.</p>
            <p style="font-size:26px">The rest is history.</p>
            <p style="font-size:26px">Shortly after, StuddyBuddy was born. Somewhere along the line, we changed our name to Wobetto, because we thought it was a better name to describe what we believed in. Wobetto is actually an acronym that stands for Work Better, Together - a belief central to what our team is trying to accomplish.</p>
            <p style="font-size:26px">Since then we’ve found more people motivated by the same goal and adopted our virtual mascot, Webster. With their help, we developed a website with a host of features to help students learn more efficiently and effectively by using their greatest resource: each other. </p>
            <p style="font-size:26px">We hope you enjoy using the app, and find that it helps you on your educational journey. Thanks for being a part of our history, we can’t wait to see what we can do in the future!</p>
